# README: M03 Seminar Applied Econometrics, Group Examination (Presentation, Code, Report)

*Spring Term 2025*

*Sandro Heiniger, PhD HSG*

*(Fernuni Schweiz)*


## Overview
This is your group's GitHub repository for the presentation and technical report. In this readme file, you will find all the instructions needed to work on your group project and the corresponding two examination parts. 

### Contents
- In the main directory of this repository you see this readme-file and four directories: `code/`, `data/`, `report/`, and `presentation/`.
- Store all of your project-related code in `code/`. You are free to organize your code in sub-directories within the `code`-directory.
- Store all data that you use for your analysis in `code/`. You are free to organize your data in sub-directories within the `data`-directory.
- In `report/` you will find a file called `Report structure template.docx`. This file serves as a template for the technical report (Examination Part I). You can write your report according to the structure pre-defined in this document and/or adapt it to your own preferences. Save your report in pdf format in this directory before the deadline; you don't submit it via Moodle or email.
- Store your presentation slides in `presentation/`(Examination Part II). Before you present in class, please ensure that your presentation file(s) in this repository is/are up to date.


## General instructions and rules

### Rules
 - Only team members are allowed to contribute to the project. 
 - The report, slides, and presentation must be in English.
 - Use an advanced programming language for statistical analysis (R or Python).
 - The paper replication and extension must be your team's original work; reusing existing work is not allowed.
 - Adhere to standard academic citation rules and principles.
 - Use of internet forums (e.g., StackOverflow), coding assistants, and AI models is permitted.
 - Submit the report and replication code through the GitHub Classroom repositories. 
 - Your team's assessment will be based on the technical report, including R code, documentation, and other relevant parts residing in this repository.
 - Your code must be documented and reproducible. All used datasets should be made accessible.
 - The slides and presentation will be evaluated on the day of your team's presentation.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f87e890-b7c1-4796-9385-6e146e01b6a6)
 
### Instructions
For all tasks of the group examination, observe the following instructions.
 - Use commenting (`#`) to document your R-code well, so others (including your lecturer in this course) can understand what the overall scripts are for and what the individual parts of a script are for.
 - Follow a common convention when writing R code. For example, follow the suggestions in [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml). You are free to follow other suggestions or define your style guide. Just make sure that all of your code follows the same style and commenting conventions.
 
### Deadlines
 - You may send me your project disposition until *16.03.2025, 23:59* to get a feedback.
 - Handing in of report is through your repository. Compile your report to a pdf file and push the final version. After *09.05.2024, 23:59* no additional changes to the repository will be possible. Thus, whatever is in your team's repository at this time/date, will be the basis for the evaluation of your team's report.
 - Presentations are held on the presentation day in Brig on *10.05.2025*.

## Tips for a successful examination
 - Working with real-life data can be tedious at times. Keep calm, plan, and organize your team well to meet unforeseen challenges with the data.
 - Make sure you commit your solutions to your team's GitHub repository step by step. Preferably, make sure the version residing in your team's repository is always the best current version of your report/slides/code. Do not wait for the last day to commit and push your solutions to the repository!


*GOOD LUCK!*
